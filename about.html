        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I've always been passionate about games ever since I was a child. From playing the built-in games on the old family Sky box to getting a PS2 hand-me-down, I loved every second of it, even if I was terrified of playing certain games. Maturing a little further, I had pivoted to using the family laptop even though it could barely run a browser without huffing and puffing, let alone any game. I remember having to turn off all shadows through console commands to get anything close to a consistent framerate barely. However, if I didn't have access to games like those back in the day, even if they barely ran, I'm not sure whether I would be who I am today.</p>
        <p>Skipping to the present, I am still as fascinated as I was with this industry, if not more now. Seeing how gaming went from a niche hobby to a global phenomenon still growing has been inspiring. Learning game programming has and will allow me to be a lasting part of that phenomenon and share the ideas I have cultivated since I was a child, which is why I am excited to get stuck into this industry as it moves forward.</p>
